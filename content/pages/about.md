# About this page


I created this website to learn more about some web developing techniques. This has been a steep learning curve, but was fun.



I am using a *static site generator* to create this website. These are usually fast, simple and don't require any databases. Of the great amount of blog-aware sytems out there (Jekyll, Hexo, Hugo, Octopress). I am using **Pelican**, mainly because it is built with Python. Other reasons: it is super fast, all the [code is available](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) and it supports plugins. Static site generators offer a good balance between the simplicity of a plain coding, and the complexity of a full content management system (i.e. Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, etc.).

For theme developpement I wanted to try all these tools we have today and that I was not familiar with:

- **Node.js** - I was not aware of how far one can get with javascript. Together with the **npm** system, you can get access to an infinity of opensource tools. Incredibly useful.
- **Bower** - Used this to manage vendor libraries with little effort.
- **Gulp** - Learned to use gulp to control common tasks when deploying. Very useful for common tasks: (compiling sass, concatenate scripts, minifying, proof checking, moving files, etc.). Oh yeah, and running a server and syncing the browser as you code was very useful.
- **Jinja2** - Pelican uses this templating engine to generate HTML output.
- **Bootstrap** - Finally, bootstrap, got used to the framework

I also dusted off some basic css(sass), html and javascript skills and also learned about **AJAX**.
