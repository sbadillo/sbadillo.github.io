**Solar Engineering of Thermal Processes** by Duffie and Beckman

Good book for CSP and PV technology. Includes fundamentals of solar raiation, heat transfer, flat plate radiation, concentrating collectors, energy storage and solar process economics for CSP technologies.
The PV section explains the design of photovoltaic systems, it also has a section for design methods.

**Photovoltaic Systems Engineering** by Roger A. Messenger, Jerry Ventre

Offers a practical engineering basis for PV system design. It provides quick exposure to all system building blocks, then examines both the whys and hows of the electrical, mechanical, economic, and aesthetic aspects of PV system design-why certain designs are done in certain ways and how the design process is implemented. Aims to form a clear understanding of the parameters involved in PV systems.
