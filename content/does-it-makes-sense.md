summary: Does solar energy makes sense?

So I would like to start the solar energy series by answering in a simple way one of the questions I often hear myself. Isn't producing a solar cells as harmful as burning fuels?

To answer the question, we will start by looking at a very simple concept called **Net Energy**, and comparing different sources of energy.

#### Net Energy

Almost all energy sources, are not usable in their natural form. Take oil for example, before it can be delivered to our homes as electrical energy, it will have undergo an exploitation process. This exploitation process will include several stages needed to transform the source of energy to a usable form of energy. 

So let's say we would like to burn one barrel of oil, then we would have to consider the stages:

* Exploring and finding the oil.
* Extracting the oil.
* Transporting the oil.
* Refining the oil.
* Constructing the facility to burn the oil.
* Repairing environmental damage caused by all of the above (In principle, this should be included).

Each of the stages above requires some energy to be completed. Here is where the concept of net energy comes into consideration.

Net Energy is the difference between the energy required to convert the source to useful energy and the actual useful energy obtained at the end.

We are not gonna dive into the numbers here, but hopefully you can get the idea. It takes more than one barrel of oil to obtain and convert the energy available in one barrel. In other words. Burning a barrel of oil has a negative net energy. 

From this simplistic point of view, we might wonder if that even makes sense to burn oil.

Net energy was introduced by Odum and Odum in 1976. The idea proposed that everything has an energy content, and introduced the *British thermal unit (BTU)* in order to measure and compare it.

Similarly, **producing solar photovoltaic cells** requires a significant amount of energy. But, over its lifetime, the solar cell will produce more energy than the energy required to create the cell itself. Using the sun as *infinite* resource, the cell will create enough energy to compensate its own production energy costs, its own disposal costs, and still end-up with a positive energy balance. 

#### So what makes a energy form «sustainable» ?

We should judge forms of energy by two criteria:

* Is it obtained from a renewable or non-renewable source?  
* Is the net energy value positive or negative?
