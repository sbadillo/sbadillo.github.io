Notes to self on getting the content right.

## Topic 1

So let's say we are writing an article with subdivisions. I would like to keep things simple so it is important not to use to many headers, as the reader can easily get discouraged by complexity.

A list example:

* item
* item
* item
* item

## Topic dos

I will try to keep division up to this level. The main division of the article will be in h2 headers.

### 2.1 Subtopic

If more detail is needed. Then I can use another subdivision like this, this is an h3. Id fugiat assumenda consectetur a cupiditate accusantium quibusdam inventore perspiciatis, qui tempore! Numquam iusto atque mollitia deserunt nesciunt odit asperiores.

### 2.2 Subtopic

This is another h3 subdivision.

<div class="blockquote"> "Quote via bootstrap class. Expedita odit velit incidunt nam quod sit dolorem repellat praesentium earum, vero modi, ducimus!"
	<div class="blockquote-footer"> "blockquoute footer "</div>
</div>
