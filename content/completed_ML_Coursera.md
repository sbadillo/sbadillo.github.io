I started this awesome course on mid April 2017. I finished it at the end of May. It took me 1.5 months to go through all the material and solving the excercises. I chose this course as the first introduction to machine learning and I am pretty satisfied with it as it covered much of the basics of the subject, passing throught the most widespread techniques. The excercises provided were very fun to do as well.
