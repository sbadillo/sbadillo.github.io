Title: Getting started with grid connected PV
date: 2017-05-29

# Intro

Grid-connected PV systems can be divided: 

* Grid-connected with no battery backup (Also called 'straight grid-connected')
* Grid-connected with battery backup
    * dc-coupled systems
    * ac-coupled systems

The most commonly installed systems are grid-connected systems. We will
focus on this type of system for now.

### Applicable Codes and Standards (In France/Europe)

Coming soon.
We are looking here for general guidelines and requirements that
guarantee safety of the end user, installer and maintainance technician. 

* Sizes and types of switches, fuses, and wire to be used.
* Location of electrical components in the systems.
* Voltage Drop and wire sizing.
* Structural Considerations
* Proper use of switches, circuit breakers, fuses, types of
* Insulation and conductions, types of electrical conduit, proper
* Grounding
* Other
    * Aesthetics
    * Electromagnetic Interference
    * Surge Protection

# Design Considerations
Ok let's jump straight determining the system energy output.

Depending on the type of PV modules we will get certain module efficiency $\eta$
